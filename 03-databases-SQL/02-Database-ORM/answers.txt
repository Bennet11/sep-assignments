1. Ruby has a vast collection of third party libraries, and most of them are released in the form of a gem.
RubyGems is a packaging system designed to facilitate the creation, sharing and installation of libraries.
Ruby gems are very useful on projects. They consist of pre made functions depending on your needs. With the help of gems,
it will save you a considerable amount of time instead of constructing functions manually.

2. With Eager loading, a function does everything that it is programmed to do when it is called. As for lazy loading, a function only do a calculation when required.

3. CREATE TABLE creates table. INSERT INTO function adds value to the table specified.

4. Extend - adds the specified module's methods and constant to the target's metaclass. Extend is a public method.
Include - mixes the specified module's methods as instance methods in the target's module/class. Include is a private method.

5. Changing from extend to include is necessary as we only want to record a change on a particular method and not an entire class. Without doing so will result to unnecessary changes to an entire class.

6. UPDATE character
   SET name = "Jar-Jar Binks"
   WHERE id = 1
   ;

7. I believe it's because we removed the initialize methods on both address_book.rb and entry.rb. Due to that discrepancy, entries is only giving us nil values. I believe we need to reestablish the an updated initialize
method, or complete the code in a way that we will connect it to the database created.

8. def snake(snake_word)
    string = snake_word.gsub(/::/, '/')
    string.gsub!((), )
  end

9. def find_by(attribute, value)
    row = connection.get_first_row <<-SQL
      SELECT #{columns.join ","} FROM #{table}
      WHERE attribute = #{BlocRecord::Utility.sql_strings(value)}
    SQL

    return find_object(row)
   end
